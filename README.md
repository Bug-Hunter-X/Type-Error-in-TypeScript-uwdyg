This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function that takes a string argument and returns a string. However, when the function is called, an array of strings is passed as an argument. This results in a type error. The solution shows how to fix this error by changing the type of the function's argument to an array of strings.
